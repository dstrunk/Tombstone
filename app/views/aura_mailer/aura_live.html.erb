<p style="margin:20px 0">Hi,</p>
<p style="margin: 20px 0;">Your aura, <b><%= @aura.name %></b>, has just been released. You can test this for yourself by using the Envision app and scanning your image. If you have any trouble with the image, let <a href="mailto:mktech@communicorp.com" style="color:#2388e0">Marketing Technology</a> know! We'll fix it ASAP.</p>
<p style="margin:20px 0;">This aura is slated to run from <%= @aura.start_date.strftime('%d %b %Y') %> to <%= @aura.end_date.strftime('%d %b %Y') %>. At the end of the campaign's run, <%= @aura.name %> will be archived. You'll receive an email when this happens so you can make sure the client knows.</p>
